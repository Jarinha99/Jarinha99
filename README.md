## Hackatons / Challenges

### 3rd Place at MPSP Challenge

MPSP (Public Ministry of São Paulo), The challenge was to collect data from several different platforms (Web Scrapping and API's) about any individual that MPSP wished to investigate and centralize on a single platform.

Our Solution: We solved it with a website in ReactJS and an architecture in nano-services using NodeJS, each responsible for a website or api, all occurring asynchronously, our differential was that the information found in some websites, were reused in the search on other sites to improve efficiency.


### 1st Place at Scientific initiation of Fiap 2018

FIAP (Paulista University of Administration and Informatics), the project was based on a booth with an original music app and a Kinect capturing the user's movements while dancing and passing to a pedestrian traffic light outside the booth, as well as the "dancing" traffic light, the idea was to get people's attention, in order to make people aware of not crossing the red!
